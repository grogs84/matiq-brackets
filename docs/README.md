## Documentation Overview

This Phase 1 analysis provides comprehensive documentation for extracting shared logic between ChampionshipBracket and ConsolationBracket components. The analysis is divided into several focused documents:

## Core Documents

### 1. **Phase 1 Analysis** (`phase1-analysis.md`)

**Contents**:
- Code inventory analysis with extraction mapping
- Proposed architecture and directory structure  
- API design for shared modules
- Areas requiring closer review (championship vs consolation differences)
- Implementation roadmap with 6 phases
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Related issues impact analysis (#16, #18, #19, #20, #21)
- Conclusion and next steps

### 2. **Extraction Mapping** (`extraction-mapping.md`)
**Purpose**: Detailed line-by-line mapping of extractable code  
**Contents**:
- Current ChampionshipBracket.jsx code analysis (516 lines)
- Immediate extractions: utilities and constants (~200 lines)
- Moderate complexity: layout logic (~150 lines)
- High complexity: tournament-specific logic (~120 lines)
- Before/after code comparisons
- 85% reusability achievement target

### 3. **API Specifications** (`api-specifications.md`)
**Purpose**: Detailed API design for all shared modules  
**Contents**:
- Constants module with BRACKET_CONSTANTS, MATCH_STYLES, TEXT_STYLES
- Data processing utilities with full function signatures
- Layout calculation APIs with parameter documentation
- SVG helper function specifications
- Shared component APIs (BracketContainer, MatchBox, ConnectingLines)
- Usage examples and integration patterns
- Performance and testing considerations

### 4. **Implementation Timeline** (`implementation-timeline.md`)
**Purpose**: Detailed phase-by-phase implementation plan  
**Contents**:
- 18-day timeline across 6 phases
- Day-by-day task breakdown
- Risk assessment for each phase
- Success criteria and validation strategies
- Rollback plans and mitigation strategies
- Resource requirements and dependencies
- Success metrics and measurement criteria

## Key Findings Summary

### **Extraction Opportunity**
- **Current State**: 516 lines in ChampionshipBracket.jsx
- **After Extraction**: ~100 lines championship-specific + ~440 lines shared
- **Code Reuse**: 85% of logic available to ConsolationBracket
- **Risk Level**: Low to Medium (using incremental extraction approach)

### **Proposed Architecture**
```
packages/matiq-brackets/src/
├── components/
│   ├── ChampionshipBracket.jsx          # Championship-specific (~100 lines)
│   ├── ConsolationBracket.jsx           # Future - consolation-specific
│   └── shared/
│       ├── BracketContainer.jsx         # SVG container wrapper
│       ├── MatchBox.jsx                 # Match rendering component
│       └── ConnectingLines.jsx          # Line drawing component
├── utils/
│   ├── constants.js                     # All bracket constants
│   ├── dataProcessing.js                # Match/participant utilities
│   ├── layoutCalculation.js             # Position and dimension logic
│   └── svgHelpers.js                    # SVG coordinate calculations
└── index.js                             # Main library exports
```

### **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Phase 2-3**: Extract utilities and constants (Low risk, 5 days)
2. **Phase 4**: Create shared components (Medium risk, 4 days)
3. **Phase 5**: Refactor ChampionshipBracket (Low risk, 2 days)
4. **Phase 6**: Implement ConsolationBracket (High risk, 7 days)

### **Risk Mitigation**
- Incremental extraction with validation at each step
- Visual regression testing with screenshot comparisons
- Clear rollback points using Git branching
- Conservative timeline estimates with buffer time

## Impact on Related Issues

| Issue | Current Scope | Updated Scope | Timeline Impact |
|-------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| #16: ConsolationBracket | Build from scratch | Use shared infrastructure | -40% time |
| #18: Connecting lines | Championship only | Shared component | +20% / -30% |
| #19: Responsive layout | Championship only | Shared utilities | Neutral |
| #20: Match interactions | Championship only | Shared MatchBox | -25% time |
| #21: Bracket validation | Championship only | Shared validation | +30% time |

## Approval Requirements

**Phase 1 Acceptance Criteria**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] Inventory of extractable code completed with mapping to proposed files
- [x] Proposed directory structure and shared module APIs agreed
- [x] "Needs review" items confirmed with decisions (generalize now vs. defer)
- [x] Scopes updated for related issues: #16, #18, #19, #20, #21
