# Wrestling Bracket Visualization - Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
Building reusable React components for double elimination brackets with a flow that is used in D1 Wrestling. The rules have changed over the years so different time periods may have different requirments on how the bracket flows and is rendered on the page.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Component Architecture âœ…
- [x] Set up React + Vite + Tailwind development environment
- [x] Create basic tabbed UI structure
- [x] Define project structure for reusable components

## Phase 1.5: Process Overview âœ…
- [x] Create a document that walks step by step what actions need to happen.
- [x] Define component-first approach and data contracts

## Phase 2: Component API & Data Contract Design âœ…
- [x] Review and refine component API design from COMPONENT_DESIGN.md
- [x] Create sample data that matches our defined contracts
- [x] Validate data structure with wrestling bracket requirements
- [x] Define tournament format configurations (NCAA 2012, etc.)
- [x] Set up component library project structure
- [x] Create data types and constants
- [x] Build first working BracketMatch component
- [x] Create basic ChampionshipBracket component
- [x] Build main WrestlingBracket wrapper component

## Phase 3: Championship Bracket Component ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Create BracketMatch component (individual match box)
- [ ] Build ChampionshipBracket component with SVG rendering
- [ ] Implement bracket positioning algorithm (32-man single elimination)
- [ ] Add connecting lines between matches
- [ ] Style match boxes with wrestler names, seeds, scores
- [ ] Add winner highlighting and visual flow

## Phase 4: Consolation Bracket Component ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Research and document wrestling consolation bracket flow rules
- [ ] Design consolation bracket positioning algorithm
- [ ] Create ConsolationBracket component
- [ ] Implement cross-bracket connections (championship losers â†’ consolation)
- [ ] Handle complex consolation advancement patterns
- [ ] Add placement match rendering (3rd, 5th, 7th place)

## Phase 5: Integration & Refinement ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Create main WrestlingBracket wrapper component
- [ ] Add responsive design for different screen sizes
- [ ] Implement bracket navigation and zoom features
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Performance optimization for large bracket rendering

## Phase 6: Package Preparation ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Extract components into reusable library structure
- [ ] Create comprehensive component documentation
- [ ] Add TypeScript definitions (optional)
- [ ] Prepare for npm package or local import patterns

## Technical Decisions Log

### Component Architecture
- **Decision**: Use SVG for bracket rendering
- **Reasoning**: Precise positioning, scalable graphics, easy connecting lines
- **Alternative considered**: Canvas (more complex) or HTML/CSS (positioning limitations)

### Data Flow
- **Decision**: Props-based data passing with optional data service
- **Reasoning**: Keep components pure and testable, allow flexibility for different data sources

### Styling Approach
- **Decision**: Tailwind CSS with custom SVG styling
- **Reasoning**: Rapid development, consistent design system, easy customization

## Current Blockers & Questions
- [ ] Need clarification on exact wrestling consolation bracket flow rules
- [ ] Determine optimal SVG dimensions and responsive breakpoints
- [ ] Decide on bracket positioning algorithm (mathematical vs. lookup table)

## Sample Data Requirements
```javascript
// Match data structure needed
{
  id: "match_001",
  round: "champ_32", // "champ_16", "champ_quarterfinals", "consi_round_8", etc.
  position: 1, // Position within round
  wrestler1: { name: "John Smith", seed: 1, school: "Penn State" },
  wrestler2: { name: "Mike Jones", seed: 32, school: "Iowa" },
  winner: "wrestler1",
  score: "7-2",
  nextMatch: { winner: "match_017", loser: "consi_match_045" }
}
```

## Notes & Ideas
- Consider adding animation for bracket progression
- Could implement bracket "replay" showing tournament progression
- Might need bracket legend explaining wrestling-specific rules
- Consider print-friendly styling option
