**Parent Issue:** #1 - Responsive & Usable Bracket Visualization

## Goal
Thoroughly test the responsive bracket layout across devices and screen sizes, fixing any issues discovered. We'll integrate Storybook to streamline responsive testing and create a foundation for future development.

## Current State
- Basic responsive structure implemented
- Need comprehensive testing across real devices and screen sizes
- May discover edge cases or usability issues

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Storybook Setup
- [ ] Install and configure Storybook for React
- [ ] Create initial ChampionshipBracket stories
- [ ] Set up viewport controls for responsive testing
- [ ] Create stories for different bracket sizes (8, 16, 32+ wrestlers)
- [ ] Create edge case stories (long names, extreme screen sizes)

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Test on desktop (1920x1080, 1366x768, ultrawide) using Storybook + real browsers
- [ ] Test on tablets (iPad, Android tablets in portrait/landscape)
- [ ] Test on mobile (iPhone, Android, various sizes)
- [ ] Test with different bracket sizes (8, 16, 32, 64+ wrestlers)
- [ ] Verify horizontal scrolling works smoothly
- [ ] Check text remains readable at all sizes
- [ ] Test with longer wrestler names
- [ ] Document any issues found and create follow-up tasks

## Success Criteria
- Storybook integrated and functional for bracket testing
- Bracket is usable on all common screen sizes
- Text remains readable without zooming
- Smooth scrolling performance
- No layout breaking or visual glitches
- Consistent experience across devices
- Visual documentation of responsive behavior in Storybook

## Testing Notes
- Use Storybook for initial responsive testing and edge case exploration
- Follow up with real device testing for final validation
- Focus on creating reusable stories for future development
