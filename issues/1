### Issue Title: Extract shared bracket utilities and consolidate common logic

#### Description:
This issue focuses on consolidating the logic between the `ChampionshipBracket` and `ConsolationBracket` components. The following areas need to be addressed:

1. **SVG Container Logic**: Identify and unify the SVG container logic used in both brackets to ensure consistency and reduce redundancy.
2. **Layout Constants**: Review layout constants shared between the two components and create a centralized location for these constants.
3. **Positioning Algorithms**: Analyze the positioning algorithms in use and streamline them to eliminate duplication.
4. **Connecting Lines Utilities**: Refactor the connecting lines utilities to be reusable between the two components.
5. **Match Rendering Logic**: Standardize the match rendering logic to promote DRY principles.

#### References:
This work should be initiated after PR #27 is merged and should be completed before continuing with issue #19.

#### Examples:
- **ChampionshipBracket Component**: The current implementation of match rendering within the `ChampionshipBracket` component shows significant duplication of logic that could be abstracted.

#### Duplication Concerns:
This issue addresses the duplication concerns that were raised during the development of the `ConsolationBracket` component, ensuring a more maintainable and cleaner codebase.
