# Responsive & Usable Bracket Visualization

## Context
This project is a React + Vite application for visualizing wrestling tournament brackets. The goal is to create a highly usable, responsive, and visually appealing bracket component that works for both desktop and mobile users, and can handle large, complex tournaments.

### Current State
- Bracket renders as a tree using SVG, with matches centered between their source matches.
- Data model uses embedded participants and explicit match pointers.
- Layout works for small brackets, but large brackets overflow the viewing area and are not mobile-friendly.

### UI/UX Consultant Feedback
#### Key Challenges
- Large brackets do not fit in the current window, especially on mobile.
- Users need to be able to navigate, zoom, and focus on specific rounds or matches.
- Accessibility and usability must be considered for all users.

#### Solution Approaches
1. **Maximize Viewing Area**
   - Make SVG/canvas as large and responsive as possible.
   - Allow horizontal/vertical scrolling for overflow.
   - Pros: Simple, quick to implement. Cons: Not ideal for mobile or very large brackets.

2. **Zoomable & Pannable Canvas**
   - Implement zoom/pan controls (mouse, touch, buttons).
   - Use libraries like `react-zoom-pan-pinch` or `svg-pan-zoom`.
   - Pros: Handles large brackets, modern UX. Cons: More complex, needs clear controls.

3. **Round-Focused/Snapping UI**
   - Allow users to focus on one round at a time, with smooth transitions.
   - Use tabs, sliders, or snapping animations.
   - Pros: Excellent for mobile, reduces cognitive load. Cons: Users lose big-picture context unless overview is provided.

4. **Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
   - Desktop: Maximized, scrollable SVG with optional zoom/pan.
   - Mobile: Round-focused snapping, with a "view all" button.
   - Always: Provide navigation controls and clear interactions.

#### Accessibility & Usability
- Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
- Make touch targets large enough for mobile.
- Provide tooltips or popovers for match details.

## Master Issue: Responsive & Usable Bracket Visualization

### Description
Refactor and enhance the bracket visualization to be fully responsive, usable, and visually appealing for all users and tournament sizes. Implement features for navigation, zooming, and round-focused views, with accessibility and usability as core requirements.

### Subtasks
1. **Expand SVG/canvas size and make it responsive**
   - Use CSS to maximize available space.
   - Allow horizontal/vertical scrolling for overflow.
   - Test on various screen sizes.

2. **Implement zoom/pan controls for desktop and mobile**
   - Integrate a zoom/pan library.
   - Add visible controls (zoom in/out, reset, fit to screen).
   - Support mouse, touch, and keyboard interactions.

3. **Add round-focused snapping UI for mobile**
   - Implement tabs, slider, or snapping transitions for rounds.
   - Animate transitions for smooth experience.
   - Show a small bracket overview for context.

4. **Add navigation controls**
   - Zoom in/out, reset, fit to screen.
   - Round selector (dropdown, tabs, slider).
   - Mini-map/overview (optional).

5. **Test accessibility**
   - Keyboard navigation.
   - Screen reader support.
   - Large touch targets for mobile.

6. **Polish layout and spacing for large brackets**
   - Adjust spacing, font sizes, and match card sizes for readability.
   - Ensure matches do not overlap or get cut off.

7. **Document usage and UX patterns**
   - Write documentation for bracket navigation and controls.
   - Explain design decisions and user flows.
